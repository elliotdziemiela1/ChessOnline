# Multiplayer Chess
by Elliot Dziemiela

Multiplayer Chess is an ASCII-based chess simulator. To play, simply run server.exe on your desired machine. Then, connect the first client by running "./client \<Server IP address\>" on a machine on the same network, and connect the second client by running "./client \<Server IP address\>" on a machine on the same network. Or, you can run your clients locally on the same machine as the server by simply running client.exe with no arguments.
