#Chess Online
by Elliot Dziemiela

Chess online is an ASCII-based online chess simulator. To play, simply run "./server" in a CLI on your desired machine. Then, connect the first client by running "./client \<Server IP address\>" on another machine, and connect the second client by running "./client \<Server IP address\>" on another machine. Or, you can run your clients locally on the same machine as the server by simply running "./client" with no arguments.
